## Simulation and Development
Our team utilized [Expo Go](https://expo.io/tools#cli) for development. This emulator allowed us to monitor our progress during development. Alternatively using an *Android* or *ios* simulator could be accomplished.

**Once Expo Go is installed:**
Run the application using

    $ expo start
   Will generate the QR code to scan and run on a mobile device

## Vue Native Documentation
Documentation for Vue Native can be found [here](https://vue-native.io/docs/basic-components.html). Our team found the examples provided by [this](https://vue-native.io/) gitHub repo to be particularly helpful in development. For additional information check out the Vue Native [GitHub home page](%5Bthis%5D%28https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core%29).

## Getting started with the backend
**MongoDB:**
In the original Younite 360 Website, the backend was implemented with mongoDB connections available upon activation. We recommend continued support with it.
